## Installation
Installation is simple, just;

1. Download the latest files, for mostly-stable versions, please visit our [releases section](https://github.com/Cyberbyte-Studios/CyberWorks/releases)
2. Unpack everything and make sure it is in a directory accessible on a running web server
3. Gently congratulate yourself with a hot beverage of your choice (I recommend Tea) and it will guide you through the setup process as soon as you visit the url in a browser
4. 
If you ever need any help please open a ticket at our new support center or on GitHub (coming soon...)

## Updating
You should just be able to replace the existing files, no settings should be overwritten.

Your server will need a few basic Apache Modules enabled such as `rewrite mcrypt` and `mysql` and we reccomend is run on Linux. IIS is not supported.
